# school
The project is structured with the following key components:

Entities: Represented by the Filiere, Role, and Student classes, these are the core data structures that map to the underlying database tables.

DAO (Data Access Object): The Impl class implements the Localschool interface, providing methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting entities. This class interacts with the underlying database through JPA (Java Persistence API) and manages the business logic associated with school management.

Client Application: The EJBClient is a simple Java SE client application that showcases how to interact with the EJBs deployed on a Java EE server. It demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for fili√®res, roles, and students.
